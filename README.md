A time tracking add-on to todo.txt, inspired by [Punch.py](http://code.google.com/p/punch-time-tracking/wiki/GettingStarted).

# Installation

Put the `card` perl script into your `.todo.actions.d` directory and make it executable.

# Usage

     % todo.sh add "Create a clone of Punch.py as a todo.txt add-on"
     1 Create a clone of Punch.py as a todo.txt add-on
     TODO: 1 added.
     
     % todo.sh card in 1
     Carding into 'Create a clone of Punch.py as a todo.txt add-on"
     
     <work to heart's content>
     
     % todo.sh card out
     Carding out of 'Create a clone of Punch.py as a todo.txt add-on'
     
More to come...
